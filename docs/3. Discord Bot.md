# 3. Discord Bot

## Verifying Players
When the webserver retrieves a request to verify a player, it will communicate
with the Discord bot. The Discord bot will go through a list of sorted order 
questions to check if they're allowed to join the Minecraft server.

__Are they an alt of an admin?__

The Discord bot will first and foremost check if the player they're reviewing
is an administrator's alt account (1). If they are an alt, then we need to
check if the owner of the alt is also verified (1). We can check if they're an
alt through the alts database (2). It allows us to add, get, and remove alt
accounts. Alt account management is currently only done through the webserver.

If they're not an alt account, then move on to the next question.

__Are they an administrator?__

This is important because administrators pass all the exceptions. We will check
if they're an administrator if they're not an alt (1). We can check if they're
an administrator using `(bot *Bot) CheckRoles()` (2), which will return two 
booleans. The first representing if they're whitelisted in the first place, and
the second represents if they're an administrator or not (2).

If they're not an administrator, then move on to the next question.

__Are they a whitelisted member?__

If they're not an administrator, let's check if they have one of the 
whitelisted roles attached to their Discord guild member object. If they're not
whitelisted, then the player is not verified to join (1). We can check if 
they're whitelisted using `(bot *Bot) CheckRoles()` (2), which will return 
two booleans. The first representing if they're whitelisted.

If they ARE whitelisted, then move on to the next question.

__Is maintenance mode on?__

Finally, if they're whitelisted, then we need to see if maintenance mode is on.
If it's on then, they are not verified to join the server. If it's off then
finally, they are allowed to enter the server (1).
